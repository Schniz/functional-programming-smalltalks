Some sessions I do in @KeyweeLabs to embrace some functional programming concepts and patterns that I like. Based on
@drboolean's great [mostly adequate guide](https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide/) and all other articles
(Medium, etc). Thank you, community!

### Setting up
* `yarn`
* Remap `<CR>` in vim while on visual mode to run the code blocks in node: `vnoremap <CR> :!node<CR>`
